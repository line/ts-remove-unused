## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è Auto-fix unused exports ‚Äî removes the `export` keyword from the declaration or the whole declaration based on its usage
- üßπ Deletes TypeScript modules that have no referenced exports
- üïµÔ∏è `--check` mode ‚Äî reports unused exports and deletable files without writing changes

## Introduction

When TypeScript's `compilerOptions.noUnusedLocals` is enabled, it's possible to detect declarations that are not referenced in your file.

```typescript
// TypeScript will throw error: 'a' is declared but its value is never read.
const a = 'a';
```

However when this declaration is exported and is not referenced by any file in the project, it's difficult to recognize this.

```typescript
// no errors will be reported even if the declaration is not used across the entire project.
export const a = 'a';
```

This is when ts-remove-unused comes in handy. ts-remove-unused is a CLI tool made on top of TypeScript that reports/fixes unused exports.

Let's say you have the following file:

```typescript
export const a = 'a';

export const b = 'b';

export const c = 'c';

console.log(b);
```

When `a` and `b` are not used in all other files across the project, ts-remove-unused will modify the file to be:

```typescript
const b = 'b';

export const c = 'c';

console.log(b);
```

Let's say you have another file in your project:

```typescript
export const d = 'd';

export const e = 'e';
```

When `d` and `e` are not used in all other files across the project, ts-remove-unused will delete the file for you.

ts-remove-unused supports various types of exports including variable declarations (`export const`, `export let`), function declarations, class declarations, interface declarations, type alias declarations, default exports and more...

Now you don't have to worry about removing unused code by yourself!

## Install

```bash
npm install @line/ts-remove-unused
```

TypeScript is a peer dependency so make sure that it's also installed.

## Usage

```
Usage:
  $ ts-remove-unused

Commands:
    There are no subcommands. Simply execute ts-remove-unused

For more info, run any command with the `--help` flag:
  $ ts-remove-unused --help

Options:
  --project <file>         Path to your tsconfig.json
  --skip <regexp_pattern>  Specify the regexp pattern to match files that should be skipped from transforming
  --include-d-ts           Include .d.ts files in target for transformation
  --check                  Check if there are any unused exports without removing them
  -h, --help               Display this message
  -v, --version            Display version number
```

The CLI will respect the `tsconfig.json` for loading source files.

Here's an example of using the cli. Make sure to skip your entrypoint file.

```bash
npx @line/ts-remove-unused --skip 'src\/main\.ts'
```

### Check

Use `--check` to check for unused files and exports without making changes to project files. The command will exit with exit code 1 if there are any unused files or exports discovered.

```bash
npx ts-remove-unused --check
```

### Use the JavaScript API

Alternatively, you can use the JavaScript API to execute ts-remove-unused.

```typescript
import { remove } from '@line/ts-remove-unused';

remove({
  configPath: '/path/to/project/tsconfig.json',
  projectRoot: '/path/to/project',
  skip: [/main\.ts/],
  mode: 'write',
});
```

### Skip

When you add a comment `// ts-remove-unused-skip` to your export declaration, it will be skipped from being removed

```ts
// ts-remove-unused-skip
export const hello = 'world';
```

The `--skip` option is also available to skip files that match a given regex pattern. Note that you can pass multiple patterns.

```bash
npx ts-remove-unused --skip 'src/main\.ts' --skip '/pages/'
```

By default, `.d.ts` files are skipped. If you want to include `.d.ts` files, use the `--include-d-ts` option.
